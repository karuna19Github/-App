You fly in on a light aircraft and can explore some of the most pristine reefs on the planet from the luxury of a purpose-built dive hotel. The house reef is a world-class dive in its own rights and there are nearly 40 other stunning sites to explore. This is an underwater photographerâ€™s paradise with some of the most vibrant and biodiverse reefs on the planet. Dynamite fishing and other dubious practices had taken their toll over the years and the amount of large pelagic life might not compare with other areas but growing conservation awareness is improving that and the sheer quality and beauty of the reefs more than compensates.")
